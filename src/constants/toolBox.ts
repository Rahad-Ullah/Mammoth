    "The clinical spectrum of small fiber neuropathy (SFN) encompasses manifestations related to the involvement of thinly myelinated A-delta and unmyelinated C fibers. The most common pattern of clinical involvement is that of length-dependent peripheral neuropathy. This form of neuropathy is symmetric, and symptoms begin in the longest nerves at their terminals (ie., distal foot). Negative (lack of feeling) or positive (prickling, tingling, burning) sensory symptoms usually precede motor weakness. The symptoms ascend insidiously up the leg, with hand symptoms often becoming evident around the time leg symptoms approach the knee. Upper limb involvement may Many peripheral neuropathies are length dependent, sensory predominant, and clinically mild to moderate in severity without major functional limitations. These neuropathies can often be effectively evaluated and managed without specialty consultation. never occur. Based on this interpretation and findings consistent with length dependent neuropathy, clinical correlation is recommended.

    "The clinical spectrum of small fiber neuropathy (SFN) encompasses manifestations related to the involvement of thinly myelinated A-delta and unmyelinated C fibers. including not only the classical distal phenotype but also a non-length-dependent (NLD) presentation that can be patchy, asymmetrical, upper limb-predominant, or diffuse. The topographic pattern of NLD-SFN is related to ganglionopathy restricted to the small neurons of the dorsal root ganglia. NLD-SFN is often associated with systemic diseases. Compared with distal SFN, immune-mediated diseases are more common than dysmetabolic conditions. Treatment is usually based on the management of neuropathic pain. Disease-modifying therapy, including immunotherapy, may be effective in patients with identified causes. Treatment of SFSN depends on the underlying etiology. Non-length-dependent SFN (NLD-SFN) is seen in approximately 25% of symptomatic cases of pure SFN. Sensory symptoms and signs in NLD-SFN are usually patchy.",
